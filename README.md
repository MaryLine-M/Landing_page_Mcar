Brief : 

Your company has for client the digital service France of a manufacturer of German cars.

On the occasion of the release of a new model of car, your customer wants to set up a landing page presenting the vehicle and its characteristics. This landing page will allow visitors to make an appointment for a test.

The goal for your client is to generate qualified leads that can then be converted into a concession during testing.

The customer imposes the registration of customer data in Mailchimp.
He needs a surname, first name, an email, a valid phone number and a postal code.
The rules of the GDPR will have to be applied.

The model was made and provided by a webdesigner. The goal is to reproduce the layout provided in HTML and CSS3.

Given the delay imposed by the customer, the model intended for mobile has not been created: the desktop model will have to be adapted.
